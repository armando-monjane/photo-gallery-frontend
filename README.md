# Book Catalogue

This is a simple web app developed using React, Next.js 13, Redux Toolkit and Typescript.

## Setup
This section explains how to get the app running.
In order to run this web app node needs to be installed (Docker container is breaking the app when a component is rendered on the server and tries to fetch data). Also make sure that [Backend](https://github.com/armando-monjane/express-typeorm-rest-api) is already running.

### 1. Install dependencies `npm i` or `yarn install`

### 2. Start the app by running  `npm run build && npm start`


### 2. The app should be ready to access at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
